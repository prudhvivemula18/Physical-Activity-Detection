# Physical Activity Detection using Sensor Data

This project classifies human physical activities (walking, standing, sitting, running, etc.) using motion-sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope).  
It demonstrates an end-to-end AI/ML pipeline â€” from preprocessing and feature extraction to model training and deployment.

# Key Highlights
- Built complete ML pipeline for activity recognition.
- Baseline ML (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep models (1D-CNN, LSTM).
- Evaluated on **UCI HAR Dataset**, achieving **XX % accuracy / YY % F1-score**.
 Deployed demo with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow Lite**.
